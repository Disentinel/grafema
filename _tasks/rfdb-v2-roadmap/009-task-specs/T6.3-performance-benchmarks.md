## Benchmark Matrix: v2 vs v1

### Write Throughput

| Scale | Measure |
|-------|---------|
| 1K nodes | nodes/sec |
| 10K nodes | nodes/sec |
| 100K nodes | nodes/sec |
| 1M nodes | nodes/sec (if feasible) |

### Query Latency

| Query Type | Measure |
|-----------|---------|
| Point lookup (by id) | p50, p99 latency |
| Attribute search (by type) | p50, p99 |
| Attribute search (by file) | p50, p99 |
| BFS (depth 3) | p50, p99 |
| Neighbors (outgoing) | p50, p99 |
| Neighbors (incoming) | p50, p99 |

### Re-Analysis Cost

| Scenario | Measure |
|----------|---------|
| 1 file change in 100-file graph | Time for CommitBatch |
| 1 file change in 1K-file graph | Time for CommitBatch |
| 1 file change in 10K-file graph | Time for CommitBatch |

### Compaction

| Measure | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Merge throughput | segments/sec |
| Space amplification | L0_size / L1_size |
| Post-compaction query speedup | vs pre-compaction |

|------------|--------|--------|
| 1K nodes | ? | ? |
| 10K nodes | ? | ? |
| 100K nodes | ? | ? |
