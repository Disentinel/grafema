# Steve Jobs Review — REG-384 (Unknown Method Alarm)

**Verdict: APPROVE**

## What’s right
- Unknown method is explicitly surfaced; no silent degradation.
- Strict mode failing on unknown method is the correct stance for correctness‑first analysis.

## Guardrails
- Don’t add heavy scans.
- Keep messaging clear (point to file/line).
