# Steve Jobs Review — REG-384 (Build Fix)

**Verdict: APPROVE**

## What’s right
- Fix is surgical and focused; no architecture drift.
- Removes friction in the build pipeline without changing user‑visible behavior.

## Notes
- Test runner hang is a tooling problem, not a product issue. Worth a small follow‑up if it blocks dev velocity.
