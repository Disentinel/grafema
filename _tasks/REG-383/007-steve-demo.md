# Steve Jobs Demo — REG-383

## Demo
Open `docs/plugin-development.md` and read the new "Execution Model & Idempotency" section after "Plugin Order." It clearly explains per-module execution and shows the correct, minimal patterns for avoiding duplicates.

## Verdict
Demo is acceptable for a docs-only change.
