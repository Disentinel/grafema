# Steve Jobs Review — REG-383

**Verdict: APPROVE**

## What’s good
- Directly addresses a real user pain point (duplicate edges from per-module execution) with clear guidance.
- Aligns with vision: makes Grafema’s graph-first workflow more predictable for plugin authors.
- No hacks or scope creep; a focused docs fix.

## What I’m watching
- Wording must be crisp: don’t imply a single global pass; be explicit about per-module/indexing-unit execution.
- Examples should feel like “the right way,” not a workaround.

## Decision
Proceed to execution (docs update only).
